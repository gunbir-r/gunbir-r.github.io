        <p>I've always been fascinated by how things work, and growing up surrounded by technology naturally drew me to 
            the world of programming. Starting with Python in tenth grade, I discovered a passion for building software that
             can make a real difference. Now, as a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, I'm building a 
             strong foundation in core programming concepts through coursework in languages like Java, Python, and C/C++. 
             Beyond my studies, I'm also actively exploring new areas like iOS development with Swift and refining my web 
             development toolkit with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (you're looking at the result!). I'm a firm believer in the 
             power of collaboration and am always excited to learn and grow within dynamic teams.

                <h3>AI-Powered Portfolio Visualizer &amp; Financial Risk Monitoring Platform <em>(In Development)</em></h3>
                <p>
                    This project is a portfolio visualization and financial risk monitoring platform designed for informed investors
                    who actively manage their own portfolios. Designed in a team of six, the platform bridges the gap between professional financial
                    tools and manual spreadsheets by offering intuitive, data-driven insights into portfolio risks
                    and market sentiment. The platform leverages AI, data visualization, and optimization
                    techniques to provide actionable investment strategies.
                </p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Frontier Optimization</strong> – Helps users visualize the optimal portfolio allocation
                        for balancing risk and return.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI-Powered Twitter/X Sentiment Analysis</strong> – Monitors market sentiment in real time
                        using AI-driven analysis of social media trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Metric Heatmaps</strong> – Displays key risk indicators such as Sharpe ratios and
                        Fama-French factors for better portfolio risk assessment.</li>
                    <li><strong>kNN-Based Equity Analysis</strong> – Uses machine learning to find similar equities based on
                        returns, volatility, and sector for smarter diversification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Risk Monitoring</strong> – Provides up-to-date analysis to help investors react quickly
                        to market changes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>
                    Many investors understand financial concepts but lack user-friendly tools to apply them effectively.
                    Existing solutions are either too complex or too basic, leaving a gap in the market. This platform
                    is designed to empower self-directed investors with intuitive yet powerful risk management features,
                    helping them optimize their portfolios with confidence.

                </ul>
                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>As a computer science student, I’ve always struggled to find a single app that effectively supports both theoretical and 
                    mathematical learning. Balancing CS concepts with math-heavy coursework is challenging, and existing study tools often 
                    focus on only one aspect. To solve this, I decided to build an all-in-one AI-powered learning assistant that adapts to 
                    various study needs, making learning more seamless and efficient.

                <p>
                    This portfolio website was designed with a focus on creating a sleek, modern aesthetic, drawing 
                    inspiration from glass-like design principles. I utilized HTML and CSS for the core structure and 
                    styling, and incorporated particles.js to create a visually engaging and dynamic background. To 
                    ensure optimal user experience across different screen sizes, I implemented a responsive navigation 
                    menu (often referred to as a "hamburger menu") using JavaScript, providing easy access to site content 
                    on smaller screens.

                    This project involved the design and development of a JavaFX-based game in collaboration with a five-person 
                    team, with a one-month timeline. From initial concept to final implementation, we adhered to Agile development methodologies, participating 
                    in weekly sprints for planning, development, and iteration. Notably, we prioritized accessibility, working with a 
                    consultant to ensure the game’s features were inclusive and usable for individuals with special needs. We leveraged 
                    software design principles, design patterns, user stories, UML diagrams, and Git to facilitate effective collaboration 
                    and project management. The project concluded with a presentation to the professor, head teaching assistant, and 
                    accessibility consultant, highlighting the game’s key features and accessibility considerations.

                    In a team of three, I collaborated to develop a C-based server for a text-based battle game. This 
                    involved implementing Unix sockets to manage player logins, seamlessly match players, and handle 
                    turn-based combat without disrupting existing matches. We also created Makefiles and configured the 
                    server to operate in noncanonical mode for efficient input handling. Going beyond the project's core 
                    requirements, we implemented custom enhancements to further improve functionality and gameplay.

                <p>
                    This project involved developing a Sokoban-based puzzle game in RISC-V assembly, presenting unique challenges in terms 
                    of low-level programming and simulated hardware interaction. I integrated D-Pad and LED input/output, simulating the 
                    hardware interface to create a user-friendly control scheme within the simulator environment. Implementing multiplayer 
                    functionality required careful management of dynamic memory and efficient input handling within this simulated context. 
                    To further enhance the game, I implemented a pseudo-random number generator using the linear congruence method. Finally, 
                    I created comprehensive user documentation, including setup instructions and a gameplay guide, to facilitate easy setup 
                    and gameplay within the simulated environment.
