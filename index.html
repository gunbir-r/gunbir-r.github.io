        <p>I am a lifelong learner with a growth mindset, constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills every day. 
            Growing up in an era of rapid technological advancements, I became fascinated by how the world around me worked. 
            This curiosity led me to the world of programming, where I took my first steps by learning Python in the tenth grade. 
            From that moment, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering—not just for my love of coding, but to 
            make a meaningful difference in people’s lives.
            <br><br>
            Helping others has always been my driving force, and I aim to use 
            technology to create solutions that positively impact someone’s day. As a Computer Science student at the University of 
            Toronto, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical concepts. I’ve honed my skills across a 
            wide array of tools and technologies, while constantly challenging myself to learn more.
            <br><br>
            Beyond my formal education, I’ve independently explored new programming languages and platforms. Recently, I’ve been diving 
            into Swift for iOS development, as well as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for web development—skills I used to design and build 
            this very website!
            <br><br>
            I am passionate about growing in dynamic environments, collaborating with others, and continuously learning to push boundaries and 
            innovate. My ultimate goal is to create meaningful, user-centric solutions that improve lives and make a positive impact on the world.
